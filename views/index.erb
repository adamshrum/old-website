    <%= %w(G'day Hi Howdy).sample %>, I'm <strong>Charlie Somerville</strong>. I'm an 18 year old <span class="ruby">Ruby</span> developer from <span class="melbourne">Melbourne, Australia</span>.
</p>

<p>
    I'm a web developer by day and a mad scientist by night. I love pushing the boundaries to see what's possible. I wrote what's possibly the only FAT filesystem driver in JavaScript, as well as a JavaScript interpreter in pure Ruby.
