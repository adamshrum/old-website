# Things I need to write up

* How CRuby dispatches certain `case` statements in nearly-constant time

* klasscache-2.0/trunk patches (maybe? most of this stuff was covered by jamesgolick, I just ported it)

* better caching for constant lookups

* walkthrough on adding the pipeline operator `|>` to MRI
