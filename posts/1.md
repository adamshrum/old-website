# How to use Ruby like PHP

If you're like me, you often want to stick a script on your web server and have it run. For that, PHP's pretty much your only option... right?

**Nope!**

Here's a little trick I did today that I'd like to share. I'll assume you're running Apache.

Add the following to a `.htaccess` file in your document root:

```apache
Options +ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .erb
DirectoryIndex index.html index.erb # and whatever else...
```

Then stick the following script in `/usr/local/bin/erb-cgi`. Make sure to set its execute bit.

```ruby
#!/usr/local/rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.3-p194/ruby

require "erubis"
require "cgi"

erb = Erubis::EscapedEruby.new ARGF.readlines.drop(1).join

puts erb.result
```

If your Ruby is installed somewhere else, feel free to change the shebang line.

Then put this in your document root and call it `time.erb`. Once again, make sure to set it as executable.

```rhtml
#!/usr/local/bin/erb-cgi
<% puts CGI.new.header %>

The time is <b><%= Time.now %></b>
```

If all goes well, you should see something similar to this: [http://hailey.lol/time.erb](http://hailey.lol/time.erb)

Enjoy!
